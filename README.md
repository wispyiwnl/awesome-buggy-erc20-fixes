# Awesome Buggy ERC20 Tokens - Fixes and Examples

This repository provides practical examples and fixes for known vulnerabilities and incompatibilities in ERC20 token contracts. The code and tests demonstrate secure implementations that address common issues found in real-world, deployed contracts.

The fixes and illustrations cover the known ERC20 token contract vulnerabilities from points A11 to C1, as cataloged in the [official repository.](https://github.com/sec-bit/awesome-buggy-erc20-tokens/blob/master/ERC20_token_issue_list.md)
